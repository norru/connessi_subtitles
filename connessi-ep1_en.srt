00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:16,256
Mom!

5
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:17,857
Yes

6
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,293
I've just arrived safe and sound
you can stop worrying

7
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:22,884
Nope!

8
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,370
the ship didn't sink this time either

9
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,280
...do you think you're talking to my ghost?

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,270
No! I'm not coming home mom, told you!

11
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,585
Yes, yes

12
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,856
I'm wondering how I'm going to survive, too
with those two airheads as roommates

13
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,773
but you gotta give up

14
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,366
Yes, yes, Debora is coming

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,880
...about which..

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
yep, speak of the devil...

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,080
No, look, Gaia, at best
would have come on a bike, you know

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,850
C'mon! Gotta hang up. I promise I'll call you back once I'm at the flat

19
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,598
All good? Ok?

20
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,600
C'mon, yep, you're gonna tell me all about auntie, later!

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
All good, come on! Ok!

22
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:06,278
Gotta hang  up, come on, bye kiss, byebyebye! Hanging up now? Bye!

23
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,409
Matey!

24
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,684
MATEY!

25
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,215
Hold on!

26
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,441
(deb_mele At the seaport to pick up my bestie and #bff #besties #love #friends #smile #fun #aardvark)

27
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,420
Dearie! How have I missed you!

28
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,273
Hm... Me too!

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,989
What are you doing out there?
C'mon, get in!

30
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,929
Ehm, no, really...  I should put my suitcase in the boot first

31
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:45,149
Ehmm... I believe they can't all fit in.
Let's do this: you hold the shoe case on your lap.

32
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,169
No, I didn't make myself clear

33
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,055
SUIT-CASE

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,529
Noun. One. Singular.

35
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,539
Yes, only one, eh! An adventurer as usual!
Then it's going to fit, for sure.

36
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,974
How was the trip, Bestie?

37
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:18,709
Look, the usual

38
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,559
You have such dark circles..

39
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,833
An hour late

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,199
The air conditioner in the cabin was out of order

41
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,599
and the inevitable sea sickness during the whole trip

42
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,160
But... is it even possible that you haven't seen my make-up tutorial on how to fix dark circles, yet?

43
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,029
Bestie, you offend me, it's one of the earliest I made!

44
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,859
Look, I'll explain that to you in person, just because it's you

45
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,849
First of all you'll need a (primer) to
enhance the (corrector's) effect

46
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:47,194
Bestie, the latter must be coloured in peach, categorically!

47
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,539
because, dearie, your complexion asks for it!

48
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,589
If one had to use an orange shade
for the blue of the dark circles
(Pollo: Pollo to Pingu: you still alive? Shall I come over and pick you up from the Islands of Oceania?)

49
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,869
what would obviously happen?

50
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,319
You'd resemble Gollum in no time
(Pingu: Return to homeland achieved, my naughty chick)

51
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,189
This is obviously only the beginning
(Pollo: Damn, I have bought a machete for nothing. Are you at home already?)

52
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,749
and then you'll need some foundation
of the same colour of your skin. Trust me,

53
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:07,659
Bestie, be careful! We both know you are wrong
(Pingu: On my way. If you feel like, meet me at the flat. Have you taken note of the address?)

54
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,319
What happens next? You take a lighter one
(Pollo: Who do you think I am? I am serious! A honest worker, not a wannabe small time journalist.)

55
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,979
you bring them out even more, and it's over

56
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,439
If even the foundation the colour of you skin weren't of any use
(Pollo: could you please write it again for me?)

57
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,841
regardless of your skin color, you purchase a corrective one
(Pingu: I knew! Via del Tasso 23, Pollo. This means yes, doesn't it?)

58
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,049
but don't use too much
(Pollo: I'm not the greedy asocial banker you paint me to others)

59
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:24,870
Then you fix everything up with powder. But, Bestie, extremely lightly!
(Pingu: Alessio is gonna be there too)

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,849
This is obviously only the beginnning, you'll take care of the rest later
(Pingu: That moron? C'mon, no, please!)

61
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,930
You could take inspiration from my tutorials

62
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,340
Yesterday, I filmed my 638th
(Pingu: He's Gaia's boyfriend, what were you expecting Pollo? If you care for me you'll come anyway.)

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,549
You'll be spoilt for choices

64
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,926
Bestie!

65
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,600
Bestie, are you listening to me?

66
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,209
Ehi! But...

67
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Who are you texting with?

68
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:42,939
With Marco!

69
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,606
Marco who?

70
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,000
Marco my best friend, Debora!

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,150
You must have seen him, let me see...

72
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,180
A billion times?

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,830
Shall we leave now?

74
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,323
Yep, put the belt on

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,080
I don't remember him anyway

76
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,115
Hm, weird

<i>(You won't ever believe how they replied to him!!! #conspiracy #vaccines #bastards)</i>

79
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,187
It's unbelievable!

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,860
What?

81
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,939
Do you know about that young activist

82
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,719
the one who is exposing them all

83
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,279
Ah, is he the one about the chips under the skin?

84
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,631
Subcutaneous, honey, they're called "subcutaneous"

85
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,849
Oh, alright.
However: yes, he is

86
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,240
What has he said this time?

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Nothing we didn't know about

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,170
I know what, you know what

89
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,559
and the informed ones know,
what vaccines do for real

90
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,529
It's not that my cousin is autistic for no reason!

91
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,430
It's the answers!

92
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,890
You should know how they replied to him!
This really is the time I get proper cross!

93
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,402
Calm down, honey!

94
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,005
Hey! Don't calm down me!
Those words make my ears bleed!
I'll spare you from those

95
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,238
And then I have to pay "some people"'s taxes!

96
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,809
You mean you pay
their wages with your taxes

97
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,658
No, Gaia
this is really disappointing, coming from you

98
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,404
It is exactly because I pay their wages, that I pay their taxes too!

99
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,627
If only they paid their taxes, bloody crooks

100
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,819
always taking on honest people

101
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,869
they want us as ignorant as goats, goats, goats

102
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:21,059
no offence intended, honey

103
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,169
No, alright

104
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,330
let's move on

105
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,569
How did they reply to him, then

106
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,794
It's obvious that you are dying to tell me

107
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,150
They told him

108
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,039
that he is an ignorant idiot

109
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,889
A brainless conspirationist

110
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,649
How dare some people look at the mirror in the morning?

111
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,919
Bunch of lobbyist-mason-bastards!

112
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,020
If only people got themselves informed just a little bit more...

113
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,580
Alas, no! And what do they do?

114
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,680
They vote for them, in the assumption of making their own interest

115
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,389
while, instead, they sling shit at society

116
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,617
the nation, the whole world

117
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:52,721
SHEEP!

118
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,379
Alessio!

119
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,899
Could you please quit putting innocent animals in harm's way?

120
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,712
Ok, honey, but they really do wave the red flag at a bull

121
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,199
They're all stereotypes!

122
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,676
Meaning?

123
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,330
Bulls are meek animals

124
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,347
It's mankind's fault for soiling their language

125
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,646
with mean and meaningless words

126
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,650
Honey, you know that I didn't intend to cause any harm!

127
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,230
Well, you still said it!

128
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,729
Have a look!

129
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,884
Look, honey, look at
what men are capable of

130
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,279
Cioè, do you know

131
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:22,369
how many scale insect does it take

132
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,250
to make two pounds of cochineal red dye?

133
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,149
Is it the first sentence of a joke?

134
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:27,960
One hundred thousands

135
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,655
dead bugs, Alessio!

136
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,482
Does it sound like a joke to you?

137
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,232
Is it so much fun, eh?

138
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,088
Now you know what you scoff together with your strawberry yoghurt?

139
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:37,904
Still with the yoghurt argument?

140
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,176
It's not like I forced the cow to give me her milk!

141
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,018
It was a yoghurt, what were you thinking?

142
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,263
Alright, let's drop it here, then!

143
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:50,165
(Ilaria: 15 minutes and we're home matey. I've got a bunch to tell! Marco's on his way, try not to shock him)

144
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,417
Ilaria is here

145
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:52,363
Ah

146
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,659
If Debora, stupid as she is, doesn't crash, they'll be here shortly

147
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,343
I told her I would pick her up on my bike

148
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,309
(Alessio: Chick incoming, buddy, better hurry)

149
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,609
(Rocco: Cooooool :D :D :D on me way)
However, Rocco is coming too

150
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,938
Hope it's not an issue

151
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,874
Your pig housemate?
Why should it?

152
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:12,242
Now, don't mix pigs with human stereotypes

153
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,370
Ah, however, Marco is coming too

154
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,080
this way we compensate

155
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,406
Ah, Marco!

156
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,782
Mr Pole-Up-His-Arse honours us with his presence

157
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,884
You are an asshole!

158
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,930
Nice sandals! German?

159
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,176
Franziskaner?

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,367
Christal orb, tell me the future!

161
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,911
Oh, oh, excuse me!

162
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,161
Did you know you look like Jessica Rabbit

163
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,467
in half?

164
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,668
(I'm downstairs, can you open the gate?)

165
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:10,858
(Right away)

166
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,372
Yes?

167
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:14,215
Ale?

168
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,636
Open, it's me

169
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,686
(I'm at your place. Don't say I don't care for our friendship)

170
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:46,906
(Is alessio talking about reptilians?)

171
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,219
(No, but I am about to share the lift with a maniac.
Remember I care for you)

172
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,092
What floor?

173
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,017
You?

174
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,232
Seventh

175
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,960
Me too

176
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,657
Coincidence

177
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,091
Slow, uh?

178
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,840
The sun came out, at last

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,790
Couldn't take any more bad weather

180
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,200
But you...

181
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,260
Yeees?

182
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,050
What team do you root for?

183
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,193
I'm not a great fan. See you later.

184
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,770
Come on, I can't believe you root for no team

185
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,753
It's been a pleasure. I have arrived.

186
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:58,169
So have I! See, what a coincidence?

187
00:10:59,071 --> 00:10:59,908
Marco!

188
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,998
Rocco...

189
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,952
Have you two been introduced yet?

190
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,230
Eh, nice to meet you, I am Rocco, Alessio's housemate

191
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,271
Marco

192
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,860
He's Ilaria's best friend, the girl who's coming back tonight

193
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,460
Please, come in

194
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,687
So, with Ilaria, fuck buddies?

195
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,162
Friendzone?

196
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,643
Friendzone!

197
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:33,331
Debora, you parked on zebras

198
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,962
I have no time to waste, dearie. Let's go!

199
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:37,088
Look, they're gonna scratch this one too

200
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,989
Those vandals!

201
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,775
Debora, the suitcase! Debora! Gotta get the suitcase!

202
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:49,506
Ma...

203
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,130
Is he the one with the pole up his arse?

204
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,323
Really!

205
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:56,733
Alright

206
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,054
But he looks a cool guy, doesn't he?

207
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,780
But, hey, do we know what team he roots for?

208
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,820
Nah, he doesn't follow football

209
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,330
Don't bullshit me!

210
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,860
Is he gay?

211
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
No

212
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,380
He's Ilaria's puppy, but she...

213
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,830
Listen, buddy, but...

214
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,230
who is the cute one, Ilaria or Debora?

215
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,199
Both are! That's why I called you. Don't you trust me?

216
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,401
Come on!

217
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,451
Brother, the heart wants what the heart wants!

218
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,601
Eh, and so does the bald eagle!

219
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,000
So then...

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,900
I hope they'll consider me, Debora.

221
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,250
After all, achieving the qualification has been expensive and horribly tiring

222
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,150
then, after such an intensive course!

223
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,780
but, nowadays, keeping one's CV up to date is paramount, you know!

224
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,970
especially for someone, like me, who hasn't yet built a strong network

225
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,292
so she's forced to accept any position

226
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:06,222

You must see this photo of a "Daubentonia madagascariensis"

229
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:13,994
Too cute!

230
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,360
Are you boys socializing?

231
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,881
Sure, honey!

232
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,170
So, Marco

233
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,050
how is work doing?

234
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,300
how many poor souls have you bloodsucked today
you there at Goldman Sachs?

235
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,450
I'm off work today, so...

236
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,240
None

237
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,039
Oh, did you watch the derby?

238
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,470
Would you remind me how much you earn?

239
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,050
I've never told you!

240
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,580
Have you got anything to hide?

241
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,750
Let me guess...

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,695
You got your job thanks to your dad, a banker like you

243
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,036
No

244
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,130
I'm afraid it's my economy and finance
master degree's fault

245
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,400
Gotta pee

246
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,650
Your family must be very wealthy!

247
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,780
Yes

248
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,600
My dad is a bricklayer!

249
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,640
I knew it!

250
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,153
A freemason!

251
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:05,741
Matey!

252
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,130
Hi matey!

253
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,832
They're all here already

254
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,408
Rocco's here too

255
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,735
you were bound to meet him at some point anyway

256
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,188
After all the horrible things about him you told me about, I can't wait!

257

Pollo!

258
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,304
Naughty chick of mine!

259
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,950
Hi, future slave of the government!

260
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,048
Hi, dumbass!

261
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,715
One minute later and I'd have strangled him!

262
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:31,538
I'm sorry

263
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,897
Hello, I am Rocco, baby!

264
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:51,578
Ilaria

265
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,420
I have heard about you, a lot

266
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,389
Has anybody told you why I have got this name?

267
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,636
I can imagine

268
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,739
your mom liked the name. Let's get out.

269
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:19,891
Ciao

270
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,467
I am Rocco, baby!

271
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,544
Would you like to know why my mother gave me this name?

272
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,789
Have I already told you how nice you and my dad have been for bringing my stuff over here?

273
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,740
I was ready to sleep on the sofa, you know

274
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,742
20 times today alone

275
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,019
Don't exaggerate!

276
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,830
But this won't pay back for all my effort

277
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,149
You're a naive chick, really

278
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,329
you even pretended you had forgotten the address

279
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:42,994
Did I?

280
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:48,049
Yep. I must let you know
that I believe I'll never trust your words again?

281
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:48,422
Ah, right?

282
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:48,972
Right!

283
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,098
And here you are, the ineffable Pingu

284
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,137
The only one able to transform a gesture of pure altruism into a fault

285
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm taking the piss, naughty chick, come on...

286
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,717
It's me taking the piss on you

287
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,187
OK

288
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:15,650
Fetch the pillow, come on!

291

No! No! No! Foul! Come on!

292
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,569
Pass it on! Pass the ball forward to him!

293
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:37,850
He's alone! No! Taken! I cannot bear the sight of them when they behave this way

Do you know how much money spins around football?

295
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Oh Ale, don't fray my balls with this stuff!

296
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm pretty sure

297
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,945
matches are all fixed

298
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,040
Have a look at the referee's watch

299
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,423
they have no shame

300
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,410
It's true!

301
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,096
Oh, holy words, brother!

302
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,299
Jesus Christ couldn't have said it better

303
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:55,668
Respect

304
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,230
Nooo! No! Again?

305
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,899
Noo no look, look, if you miss this... Don't miss...

306
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,314
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

307
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,756
Nooooo!

308
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,422
Do you mind?

309
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,619
What?

310
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,174
I have to send a voicemail to my sistas

311
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,002

you do understand what I am trying to say, don't you?

330
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:14,803
Yes, I do

331
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,970
And perhaps

332
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,560

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:28,990
Says the banker son of a bricklayer

354
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,642
Oh my god!

355
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,440
Oh my god, it's them!

356
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:32,909
Is that... About the job?

357
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,540
Yes, I didn't think they would call me today

358
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,427
What are you waiting for? Answer it!

359
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,734
Do you mind?

360
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,642
Ah, sorry!

361
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:44,111
Hello?

362
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:46,211
Yes, it's me

363
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,020
Ilaria Visconti

364
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,420
Everything alright?

365
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,770
Is Ilaria ok, that is?

366
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,638
Yes, yes, everything alright

367
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:57,543
Did she mention the job interview she had with that newspaper last week?

368
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:00,425
They have just called her

369
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,440
Job?

370
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,690
Newspaper?

371
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,875
Has anybody said

372
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,110
PARTY?

373
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,915
(Mangled: come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer)

374
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,020
I understand

375
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,080
They have called her so quickly

376
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,610
Does our dear Ilaria know someone from the Bilderberg group?

377
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,080
Nip it in the bud, shall we?

378
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,800
You nip it, so you can eat the bud!

379
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,370
Did you get it?

380
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,164
He told her "eat the bud" because she's a vegan

381
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,260
You, piece of shit!

382
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:58,080
It's fertiliser, honey. I do it for you!

383
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,870
Marco told me they called you for the job

384
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,124
How did it go?

385
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,860
I got the job

386
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,790
Let's celebrate right away!

387
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,245
No no no no no no, guys! No, no, no

388
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,901
They have asked me to write an article immediately

389
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,506
and I'm very tired

390
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:13,589
I can't

391
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,801
I promise you we'll do it another day

392
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,717
we'll celebrate properly

393
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:18,622
Though, if you could stay...

394
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:20,888
no problem with that

395
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,265
No, no

396
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm working tomorrow, I'd better go

397
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,060
Sucking blood in arrears, right?

398
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,254
Bye guys

399
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:30,177
Bye

400
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,207
I think I am going

401
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,000
to stay here a little bit longer

402
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,984
Cool

403
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,210
What are you playing? Angry birds?

404
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:17,858
Three more deaths caused by the heat:  Killer Giasone

405
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:23,913
What are meteorologists hiding?
